I created this repository and added my team members to collaborate.  
I will review commits, manage branches, and merge final changes here.

## ✏️ Ayesha
Github has a clean and user friendly interface. The navigation is easy for beginners. Creating our first repository was straightfprward.
Key Features: one click branch creation, visual commit history and seamless collaboration tools that make team projects manageable.
Conclusion: Overall, Github is highly  effective for group assignments. The mobile accessibility, though limited, allows basic monitoring and edits.

# Introduction
Version control systems are software tools that help developers track changes, manage updates, and collaborate efficiently on shared projects. They allow multiple users to work on the same files without overwriting each other’s work.
GitHub is one of the most popular version control platforms used worldwide. It provides a web-based interface for hosting repositories, managing branches, and reviewing code. Through GitHub, developers can work together from different locations while maintaining an organized project history.
# Details
As a collaborator in our GitHub project, my main role was to contribute updates to the shared repository created by our leader. I first cloned the repository using the command `git clone <repository link>` and then created a new branch named `iqra_branch` to work independently.
In my branch, I added content to the project report and made multiple commits to record every change clearly. After making the updates, I pushed my branch to GitHub using the command `git push origin iqra_branch`. This allowed our leader to review and merge my work into the main branch.
Through this process, I learned how branching and committing make teamwork organized, as each member can add their own part without affecting the main project until it is reviewed.
# Conclusion
Working as a collaborator on GitHub helped me understand the complete workflow of version control. I learned how to manage my own branch, make commits, and push updates for review. It also gave me experience in handling possible conflicts and understanding how teams maintain coordination while working on the same project.s
This activity improved both my technical and teamwork skills. It showed me that GitHub is not just a tool for storing code, but also a platform that supports communication, organization, and collaboration among team members.

## 🔁 Notes
- Every member should create their own branch before editing.  
- After editing, commit and push changes.  
- Finally, the leader will merge the updates into the main branch.
